1. look at only requiring the model one, not in every route file
2. Add schema validation (including listing possible values for action.type)
3. look at error handling best practices (including HTTP error codes to api users)
4. remove json response messages when not needed (eg "Created User")
5. look in to naming all the functions. Annonymous functions suck ass IMO
6. write a read me file as documentation
