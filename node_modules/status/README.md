## Introduction

Shh... It's okay - everything is going to be alright. status is here to make all of your nightmares go away. 

status provides a flexible JSON interface on top of any commands/tasks/sensors/signals/hardware/etc you want to automate. status operations can be run locally (via the CLI) or remotely (via the REST server).

## Usage

### Command Line

```javascript
// Specify a plugin and the output you want back
// In this example I specify the 'uptime' plugin with the 'total' operation
$ status uptime total
{"total":{"hours":7,"minutes":40,"seconds":6}}

// You can pass arguments to operations too!
// Arguments can be any javascript objects separated by commas
$ status processes grep["skype"]
{"grep":[{"id":1234, "name":"skype"}]}

// Chaining operations will run them asynchronously
$ status cpu temp:usage:speed
{"temp":107.6, "usage":10, "speed":2100}

// Combine them all and have fun!
$ status cpu temp["celsius"]:usage["total","mhz"]:speed["ghz"]
{"temp":42, "usage":100, "speed":2.1}
```

### REST API

```javascript
// Specify a plugin and the output you want back
// In this example I specify the 'uptime' plugin with the 'total' operation
POST /status/uptime "total"
{"total":{"hours":7,"minutes":40,"seconds":6}}

// You can pass arguments to operations too!
// Arguments can be any javascript objects separated by commas
POST /status/uptime "grep['skype']"
{"grep":[{"id":1234, "name":"skype"}]}

// Chaining operations will run them asynchronously
POST /status/cpu "temp:usage:speed"
{"temp":107.6, "usage":10, "speed":2100}

// Combine them all and have fun!
POST /status/cpu "temp['celsius']:usage['total','mhz']:speed['ghz']"
{"temp":42, "usage":100, "speed":2.1}
```

## Writing Plugins

Let's write a plugin called "coolkern" that returns the kernel version

```coffee-script
{exec} = require "child_process"

coolkern =
  meta:
    name: "coolkern"
    author: "YOU"
    version: "0.0.1"

  version: ->
    exec "uname -r", (err, stdout) => 
      @done stdout
```

Simple enough, right? Now add it to status 

```coffee-script
status = require 'status'
status.load coolkern
```

Finished! Now you can test it out

```
$ status kernel version
{"version":"3.3.7-1-ARCH"}
```
